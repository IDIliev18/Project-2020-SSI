            <h1>What's Blue Economy</h1>
            <p>
            According to the World Bank, the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth,
            improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem."
            European Commission defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of
            interlinked established and emerging sectors.
            After years of hard work and experimentation, scientists have developed a way to turn river delta churn into electrical
            energy, an idea known as blue energy. The work has developed incrementally over time as scientists take down obstacles
            one by one using cutting-edge technology. Rutgers scientists have unlocke d the latest step and offered hope that the
            energy-capturing film can be manufactured in big enough pieces to be worthwhile.

            The spaces where rivers of fresh water crash into oceans and seas, called estuaries or deltas depending on their
            structure, hold huge energy potential because of the way salt water and fresh water interact and redistribute each
            other. In 2013, French scientists began studying this potential by pairing a silicon-based film and a boron-based
            nanotube to make a charged filter that only let positively charged ions through.
            Electrical charge in particles behaves the same as magnetic charge, where like repels like. The nanotubes have a strong
            negative charge that keeps other negative particles out. Sorting water in this way means creating two discrete pools
            with a huge charge difference between them, and harnessing the energetic salts charge differential is what generates
            electricity. This is also why our bodys electrical systems are enabled by salty electrolytes dissolved in water.
